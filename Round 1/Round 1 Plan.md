# Flatland Round 1

## To-Do:

* Create Interface to run C++ code in Python. Therefore, the C++ implementation of the MAPF algorithms could be used directly. 
    * May require modifications on the C++ algorithms to allow output that could be directly fed to Flatland Library. 

* Alternatively, Implement algorithms in Python and use it with the Flatland Library directly. 


## List of Algoithm(s):

please list algorithms that you would like to try in the 1st round.
